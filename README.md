## Summary: 
## Advantages/Disadvantages 

Code refactoring / restructuring is crucial to reducing complexity and adding efficiencies to code. This allows for increased legibility for any user to view the code. On the other hand, code refactoring can be time consuming which can be very costly. Businesses might not have the resources or capital necessary to refactor code and therefore perpetuate improperly written code.
